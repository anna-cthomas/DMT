**FEATURES TODO**
--
- Create tweets on a canvas - like drawing on paper.
- Could implement a basic MS paint and upload media directly drawn in the app

- Start in museum lobby -> sign into guest book -> pop-up window for twitter authorization
- Enter museum, displays text posts as framed paintings
- Facing a text post and clicking 'enter' will display the author and their bio, as an artist would in a museum
- Exits to return to the lobby exist every 10 or so tweets
- Add surprise rooms for fun (you can collect these themed rooms - they have easter egg content, maybe our favorite tweets?)
- Highlight canvases when a tweet has been edited(?)
- Have museum theme packs
- Sponsors display as pixel art on canvases (or theme packs!)

**TODO**
- Reformat backend to py for twscrape?
